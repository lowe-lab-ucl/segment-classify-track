# Multiclass segment-classify-track pipeline subdirectory

The notebooks in this directory differ from the related ones in the main `pipeline_notebooks` directory as they are for segmenting, classifying and tracking multiclass image data i.e. if you have 2 or more populations of cells to analyse. The alignment notebook works irrespective of number of classes, hence not having a copy here.
